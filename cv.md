## <a name="profile">Profile</a>
A focused and collaborative fullstack engineer with excellent communication, problem-solving skills and leadership skills. 

With 5+ years professional experience spanning CSS to CDNs I have a broad skillset that allows me to understand and resolve complex challenges and to deliver on work that I am deeply proud of. Alongside technical best practice I advocate for culture, accessibility, documentation and mentoring in my teams. 

Beyond work, I am a boxer, a reader, a British Sign Language teacher and an active member of my local Women Who Code group.
